DO NOT RUN "MatMatClass.m":

	It is a helper class for "A6_Question1.m" containing code for our measuring the time of our different 
	Matrix Multiplication routines. Refer to it when reading my report to follow along with my reasoning.

TO RUN "A6_Question1":

	1) Open "A6_Question1.m" in MATLAB
	2) Press the Dropdown arrow underneath the RUN button and enter a "figureNum" integer parameter to find the times for each
		Matrix class that we wish to time. More information given in the header comment.

TO RUN "A6_Question2":

	1) Open "A6_Question2.m" in MATLAB
	2) Press the Dropdown arrow underneath the RUN button and enter a "figureNum" integer parameter to find which iterative 
		solver to run. Additionally, enter the "A1andB1" boolean parameter to determine if we want to run either 
		A1x=b1 or A2x=b2 for said iterative solver.

Please read the report for my official plots and printed material. It will provide visual insight for running my programs
incase this isn't enough information.

Also, for Question 2, please refer to data located in "A6_PartC_Sheet.pdf". This is where all my recorded data lies which I talk
about in my report.
