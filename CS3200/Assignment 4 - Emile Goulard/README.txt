TO RUN "A4_Question1":

	1) Open "A4_Question1.m" in MATLAB
	2) Press the RUN button. 
		-You will see two graphs that should represent the Absolute and Relative Error Plots for n=1,2,3,...,10

TO RUN "A4_Question2":

	1) Open "A4_Question2.m" in MATLAB
	2) Press the Dropdown arrow underneath the RUN button and enter a "numOfDecimals" parameter to find the approximation of pi/4.
		-This parameter represents the number of significant decimal places related to the number of arctan expansion terms.
		-There will also be a plotted graph that represents the rate of convergence using the Shanks Transformation formula.

TO RUN "A4_Question3":

	1) Open "A4_Question3.m" in MATLAB
	2) Press the Dropdown arrow underneath the RUN button and enter an "numOfDecimals" parameter to find the convergence of pi_approx to the
		actual solution of pi.

Please read the report for my official plots and printed material. It will provide visual insight for running my programs
incase this isn't enough information.
