TO RUN "a1.m"

	1) Open "a1.m" in MatLab
	2) Once you have the code, you can press the RUN button to start running it
	3) It will prompt you to enter the parameters with values before running. 
		You can read over the comments to understand which values go where! 
		After entering the parameter values in, you'll see two graphs which are detailed in my Report pdf ("Emile Goulard - Assignment 1 - Report")
